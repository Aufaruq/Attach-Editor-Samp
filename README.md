# deficiencies in the source code
This is my project, whether it can be said to have failed or not, but there are still many shortcomings that I have to fix, namely
about spawn, yes as you can see my character spawn is still very ugly, and also about my dialogue which is quite uninteresting, therefore if you want to help develop it together I am very happy to accept it, contact me via discord: aufaruq#1

## about
This is the source code developed by Southclaws but for some reason he didn't continue it, and also I have tried from the archive he has which is filterscript, but it doesn't work well, therefore I tried to make a full gamemode version like other editors, Even though there are many shortcomings, the function inside is what I expected
